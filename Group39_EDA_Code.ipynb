customers** who **enrolled and later cancelled** (based on `EnrollmentDateOpening` and `CancellationDate`) **without any recorded flight activity** during the observation window.\n","- Because CLV in this dataset is operationally tied to loyalty activity (points accumulated/redeemed and their dollar value), these customers have **no observable contribution** to CLV.\n","\n","**Decision & rationale**\n","- We set `Customer Lifetime Value = 0` and `Income = 0` **only** for customers with **CLV missing** *and* **no flight activity**.\n","- This is a **transparent, conservative, and business-consistent** treatment: no activity → no realized (or observable) value.\n","- We deliberately avoided imputing a positive value (e.g., tier/country median) because that would fabricate value not supported by behavior, potentially biasing segmentation and KPIs.\n","\n","**Notes**\n","- If a different business rule is preferred (e.g., imputing a peer median for reporting comparability),
